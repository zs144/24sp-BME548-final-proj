## Required Packages

```
matplotlib==3.5.1
numpy==1.21.5
patchify==0.2.3
Pillow==10.3.0
torch==2.2.1
torchvision==0.17.1
tqdm==4.66.2
```

To run the code, make sure you have all the required packages installed.



## Required Hardware

The code is run and tested on 2 NVIDIA TITAN RTX. Each has 24576MiB memory. Readers are recommended to use equivalent or better GPU devices. A rough estimation to complete running `38-Clouds-UNet-train.ipynb` is about 100 minutes.



## Source Data

Due to the huge size (~13GB) of the source data, it's impossible to attach them with the source code together in a small ZIP file. Still, readers can easily download them from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sorour/38cloud-cloud-segmentation-in-satellite-images), which will direct to this dataset on Kaggle. Readers can also choose to read this [README](https://github.com/SorourMo/38-Cloud-A-Cloud-Segmentation-Dataset?tab=readme-ov-file) file provided by the original creator of this dataset. It has some useful information about the data and how this dataset is created. Note that they didn't upload the patches for ground-truth masks in the testing set. Thus, readers need to use my self-written script, `patchify_entire_gt.py`, to divide those giant masks into patches first. The script has been verified to work well by carefully matching the mask patch and image patch.



## Model Checkpoints

To save some space, we only remain `38-cloud-unet-ep20-lr0p005.pth` as it is the best checkpoint of our core model. To download more checkpoints, please go to this Google Drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13xSJvE3dgJcIbYDOofFXEsAbc2yySZB4?usp=drive_link).
